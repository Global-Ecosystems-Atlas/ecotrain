## Overview

The **EcoTrain Training and Validation Dataset** provides reference data for the study, modelling, and mapping of **Ecosystem Functional Groups**, based on the [Global Ecosystem Typology](https://global-ecosystems.org/). It is designed to support a wide range of applications in ecosystem analysis, research, and environmental decision-making. The dataset is structured for interoperability, allowing integration with common geospatial and analytical tools. By providing standardised, high-quality data on Ecosystem Functional Groups, EcoTrain enables consistent and reliable analyses across the world, supporting both scientific research and practical environmental management.


## Download the dataset

EcoTrain is not yet publicly available and is planned for public release in **late 2026**.
